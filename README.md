Functionality 2.3

I had everything working properly but once I started refactoring, I was no longer able to create a crypted file. My cli works without a given date or key.

OOD  3.5

I was able to take all the wet code and implement it into modules. I could speak to all of my code. No class is particularly long

Ruby Conventions and Mechanics 3.5

All code is properly indented with spacing that makes reading easy. All methods are less than 10 lines. I selected the most effective enumerables to my knowledge and what I researched.

TDD 2.5

I have 100% test coverage on SimpleCov. I believe the tests are robust and test for a various different things. I did not cover edge cases

Version Control 2.8

I did a minimum of 30 commits and 3 pull requests. I tried my best to commit often and break out the project per PR

Final Grade = 2.92
